These sample data may be used in Postman to test the APIs

Sample Vehicles:

Vehicle 1: Correct sample

{
    "regNo": "32322KI123",
    "vehicleModel": "Yamaha1",
    "purchaseDate": "07-11-2000",
    "insuranceExp": "17-10-2101"
}

Vehicle 2: Incorrect sample

{
    "regNo": "32322",
    "vehicleModel": "Moto109",
    "purchaseDate": "07-11-2000",
    "insuranceExp": "17-10-2101"
}

Sample Owners:

Owner 1: Correct sample

{
    "ownerName": "Vijay",
    "licenseNumber": "12322333jAj12122",
    "address": "Howrah",
    "phoneNo": "9893202085",
    "email": "vijaypoddar.kgec@gmail.com"
}

Owner 2: Incorrect Sample

{
    "ownerName": "Sanjay",
    "licenseNumber": "12322333jAj",
    "address": "Howrah",
    "phoneNo": "79888262k1",
    "email": "vijay.kgec@gmail.com"
}

Sample GPS Data:

GPS 1: Correct Sample

{
    "latitude": "1.1",
    "longitude": "-20"
}

GPS 2: Incorrect Sample

{
    "latitude": "91.1",
    "longitude": "-200"
}

Sample Vehicle-Owner Mapping:

You can establish a mapping between owners and vehicles after creating a few Owner and vehicle samples:

Mapping 1:

{
    "vehicleId": "2",
    "ownerId"  : "1"
}

Mapping 2:

{
    "vehicleId": "1",
    "ownerId"  : "1"
}

These sample values can be used to demonstrate the GPS tracking project with realistic data.
Use these values to populate the database and test various API endpoints, such as retrieving GPS data,
calculating distance traveled, and accessing vehicle information based on ownership.
